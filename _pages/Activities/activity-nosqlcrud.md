  goals: 
    - "To explore the core operations on an unstructured data store: create, update, read, and delete (CRUD)"
    - "To be able to implement each of the CRUD operations on a NoSQL database in Python"

      questions:
        - "Investigate how to create an index in a MongoDB collection using PyMongo."
        - "What kind of data do you think is best suited for a relational database, and what kind might be better suited for this non-relational approach?  As a group, write down three examples of each.  Let's compare with the class and see who has the most unique ideas!"

      questions:
        - "Modify the above program to insert records into a datastore and query them, iterating over the results."
        - "Which statements search for items according to their value?"
        - "How is the sorted cursor sorted?"
        - "Investigate how to search for records that contain a key called <code>val3</code> in your collection.  <strong>Hint: consider the <code>$exists</code> clause.</strong>"
        - "By default, multiple items in a <code>find</code> are combined using a boolean <code>AND</code> operation.  Investigate how to search by combining search terms with an <code>OR</code>.  <strong>Hint: Consider the <code>$or</code> clause.</strong>"

      title: Update
      questions:
        - "What do you think <code>$set</code> and <code>$unset</code> do?"
        - "What would the <code>update</code> without the <code>multi</code> modifier do?"
        - "What does <code>$push</code> and <code>$rename</code> do?"
        - "What does the <code>findAndModify</code> statement do in this example?"
        - "What do you think would happen if the <code>query</code> parameter is set to <code>{}</code> in the <code>find</code> and <code>update</code> statements above?"

      title: Delete
      questions:
        - "What is an alternative to removing items from a datastore so that you never actually delete anything, while omitting &quot;removed&quot; records from your queries?"
        - "Do you think the <code>query</code> parameter works with <code>remove</code>?  Try it out, and remove all items from the collection whose <code>val1</code> value is greater than 42!"
