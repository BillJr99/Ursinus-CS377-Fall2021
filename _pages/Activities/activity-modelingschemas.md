excerpt: "CS377: Database Design - Data Modeling and Schemas"

info:
  goals: 
    - To identify use cases appropriate to the relational, network, and hierarchical database model
    - To create database schemas in standardized formats

    - model: |

      title: Network and Hierarchical Data Models
      questions:
        - "What do edges (or vertices) represent in each model?"
        - "Do these edges represent 1:1 or 1:many relationships?"
        - "How might you implement each of these models using the traditional relational database model?"
        - "Sketch a model of the student enrollment tables we made previously in the hierarchical model."
        - "Design tables and keys to represent the manager-employee hierarchical model."
    - model: |

      title: Database Schemas 
      questions:
        - "Draw lines between the foreign keys that you find and their primary keys.  What do you notice about these lines, with respect to the clusters of tables?"
        - "Which tables need to be modified to add a log message to the database?  Do any records need to be modified elsewhere?  How might you define the concept of <strong>physical data independence</strong> based on this idea?"
        - "How might you define <strong>logical independence</strong> (independence within the schema itself), given our definition of physical independence?"
