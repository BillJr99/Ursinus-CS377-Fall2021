      description: Partner Design Review Reports
      preemerging: At least one review report is present, and the report lists at least one instance of style and one area for improvement
      beginning: At least one review report is present, and the report presents in detail at least two instances of style and two areas for improvement
      progressing: At least two review reports are present, and each report lists at least three meaningful instances of style and three areas for improvement
      proficient: At least two review reports are present, and each report presents in detail at least three meaningful instances of design style and three areas for improvement

      description: System Revision
      preemerging: The sample revision resulted in lower quality than the original sample, but the system remained functional after the review
      beginning: The sample was revised according to some of the feedback received, but the revision was not an improvement to the design as identified by the reports
      progressing: The sample was revised according to at least some of the feedback received
      proficient: The sample design and implementation were revised appropriately according to the feedback received

      description: Writeup and Submission
      preemerging: An incomplete submission is provided
      beginning: The program is submitted, but not according to the directions in one or more ways (for example, because it is lacking a readme writeup or missing answers to written questions)
      progressing: The program is submitted according to the directions with a minor omission or correction needed, including a readme writeup describing the solution and answering nearly all questions posed in the instructions
      proficient: The program is submitted according to the directions, including a readme writeup describing the solution and answering all questions posed in the instructions

In this lab, you will review a sample from each partner in your group, identify good examples of database design principles, and make recommendations for improvement.  When you receive these recommendations from each partner, implement them in your project database design *and* program implementation, and submit your chosen project along with the report you received.

You will work in groups of three in this lab, so that each person will review the code of two other people, and receive feedback from two others as well.

## What to Do
Choose one of your recent database design and implementation projects (a lab or an assignment), and exchange it with your partners, one-at-a-time.  You can do this by sharing your screen with them via a Zoom or Google Hangouts connection.  While your partner is reviewing your project, you can review theirs.

Write a report of at least one page for each partner's work, commenting on their database design and implementation code style.  Specifically, you should highlight at least three items that were done well in terms of code readability and style as well as database system design, plus at least three items that could be improved.  You will be asked to make the changes from your partner's feedback, so the more detailed and specific you can be about what to do, the easier it will be for your partner (and, in turn, for you!).  

When you are finished writing your reports, exchange each with the appropriate partner.  Each partner should take turns sharing their screen and allowing the other partners to discuss the code and their reports as a group together.

Remove the work you received from your partners when finished.

## A Word about Code Reviews

Sharing your code with others in a [code review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review) for feedback can feel unnatural at first, since you are exposing your creative effort to others for their opinions.  Writing code is indeed a creative process, and it reveals something about the way each individual thinks about solving problems.  One important thing to remember is that the code review process does not exist to critique one's approach to problem solving; instead, the goal is to find bugs or vulnerabilities in that code, and to help elevate everyone's coding quality by discussing best practices as a group.  I remember learning programming the first time and wondering "am I really doing this correctly?"  Code review offers a peer review process that is intended not to critique your work, but rather to offer opportunities to elevate your code quality in ways you might not have considered before.  Computer Science and software development are collaborative disciplines and activities, and writing code that is easy to share with others benefits your team and your software's users.  Remember that it is not personal: it is about helping each other to make good code even better.

## Exporting your Project for Submission

When you're done, write a README for your project, and save all your files, before exporting your project to ZIP.  In your README, answer any bolded questions presented on this page.
